# User Card Assignment

## Thoughts

I wanted to try to utilize flex box quite a bit in this assignment since that's been the focus of this section, so I experimented with using the flex-direction to sort various divs into vertical groups (specifically using column) so that it'd be easier to align properly, and using the flex property (specifically flex-grow) to space items.  
Ultimately I'm happy with how it turned out, however, I found myself trying a lot of different alterations while recreating the mockup. Because of that I think there's no doubt there could be "better" approaches, so if anyone viewing this has any input I'd be happy to hear your thoughts.  
Notably I think the use of padding or margin could maybe be improved? That and trying to make it more responsive might be a nice touch.  

## Other

I added a few extra stylistic choices like a curved border and a drop shadow since I liked the added flavor it provided.
